# Context Engineering

## Overview

Context engineering is the discipline of designing and delivering the right information and tools, in the right format and at the right time, so an AI system (LLM/agent) can plausibly accomplish a task. It moves beyond one-off prompts to an engineering practice that selects, structures, and validates context across instructions, history, retrieval, tools, and outputs.

This guide explains the shift from prompt engineering to context engineering, core concepts (contextualization, memory, retrieval, windowing), and practical usage in developer workflows—especially in VS Code with Copilot.

## What is prompt engineering? (basic concepts)

Prompt engineering is the craft of writing clear instructions to steer model behavior for a single interaction. Core ideas:

- Role/Instruction: Tell the model who it is and what to do.
- Constraints: Tone, format, length, style.
- Examples/Few-shot: Show target patterns.
- Output schema: e.g., JSON with required fields.


Prompt engineering is still necessary, but by itself it doesn’t manage conversation history, external knowledge, tool use, or evolving tasks.

## Why transition from prompt engineering to context engineering?

As applications grew into agentic systems, failures were less about wording and more about missing or messy context. Context engineering addresses:

- Dynamic inputs: user state, environment time, tools, APIs, documents.
- Long-running tasks: memory across turns and sessions.
- Retrieval at call-time: fetch only what’s relevant.
- Format rigor: structure inputs/outputs so models and downstream steps can rely on them.


References: LangChain’s “rise of context engineering,” Phil Schmid’s “not prompting, it’s context,” and DAIR.AI’s guide emphasize that most agent failures are context failures—not model failures.

## Key differences: prompt engineering vs. context engineering

- Scope
	- Prompt engineering: One-shot or narrow task phrasing.
	- Context engineering: A system that assembles instructions, memory, retrieved knowledge, and tools per task.

- Inputs
	- Prompt: Mostly static text + few-shots.
	- Context: Dynamic data (history, user prefs, docs, APIs), plus tool definitions and schemas.

- Mechanism
	- Prompt: Template/wording tweaks.
	- Context: Retrieval, selection, summarization, formatting, validation, and evals.

- Success criteria
	- Prompt: Good output once.
	- Context: Reliable performance across sessions, users, and tasks.

## Key concepts in context engineering

- Contextualization
	- Tailor instructions and content to the task, user, time, and environment. Use delimiters, roles, and explicit fields to avoid ambiguity.

- Memory (short- and long-term)
	- Short-term: Conversation state, chain-of-thought scratchpads, step summaries.
	- Long-term: Durable user prefs, past artifacts, plans; store and retrieve when relevant.

- Retrieval (RAG and tool selection)
	- Chunk, index, and retrieve relevant knowledge from docs/DBs; also retrieve the right tools (“tool loadout management”) and their concise specs.

- Windowing (context window management)
	- Curate what enters the context window: rank, trim, summarize; avoid context poisoning, distraction, confusion, and clash (DataCamp). Use schemas and validators to keep the window clean.

- Structured I/O
	- Define strict output schemas (e.g., JSON) and show examples; parse and validate before passing downstream.

- Evaluation & observability
	- Trace inputs/outputs, measure task success, and iterate. Use evals to verify context changes actually help.

## Why context engineering is a must-have skill now

- Agentic apps are dynamic: correct data and tools change by task and time.
- Large windows don’t fix relevance: more tokens can degrade performance (distraction).
- Costs/latency matter: selective retrieval, caching, and memory reduce calls.
- Reliability demands process: structured context, validation, and evals turn demos into products.

## Benefits of context engineering

- Higher task success and fewer hallucinations.
- Consistent outputs via schemas and validators.
- Lower latency/cost through targeted retrieval and caching.
- Better user experience: personalization from long-term memory.
- Easier debugging: traces reveal missing or misformatted context.

## Example usages

- Customer support copilot
	- Context: last tickets, entitlement status, product docs, tool access to CRM.
	- Output: JSON with resolution options, confidence, and next action.

- Coding assistant
	- Context: call graph, referenced files, test failures, recent diffs.
	- Tools: grep/search, unit test runner, package manager.

- Research agent
	- Context: user query, date/time, source constraints; retrieves papers/posts; summarizes into a structured brief.

## Use context effectively with VS Code + Copilot (agent mode and chat)

Practical patterns you can apply immediately in VS Code:

1. Curate source context
	- Keep a high-signal `README.md` at the repo root describing goals, architecture, conventions, and Definition of Done.
	- Add task-specific docs (e.g., `docs/feature-x.md`) with requirements, constraints, and references.
	- Maintain docstrings and module headers summarizing responsibilities and data shapes.

2. Make context discoverable
	- Name files and symbols descriptively; add cross-links in docs.
	- Keep small, focused commits with clear messages—Copilot can use recent diffs in reasoning.

3. Structure requests to Copilot Chat
	- Start with a compact brief: Goal, Constraints, Inputs/Outputs, Success criteria.
	- Point Copilot at specific files or selections before asking (“Use the selection and `tests/...` when refactoring X”).
	- Ask for a plan first, then implementation. Request a patch that includes tests.

4. Provide schemas and examples
	- When you need structured outputs (e.g., config, JSON), include a minimal schema and a valid example in your prompt.

5. Control the window
	- Keep prompts short and explicit. Prefer summaries over raw dumps.
	- When context grows, summarize prior steps and link to sources rather than pasting everything.

6. Add lightweight evals
	- After changes, ask Copilot to run or write a minimal test and report pass/fail. Keep a short checklist (build, lint, unit tests).

7. Cache and retrieve
	- Save common queries/snippets (e.g., troubleshooting steps) in a `snippets/` or `playbooks/` folder for quick retrieval in future tasks.

Context template you can paste into Copilot Chat:

- Role: [who the assistant is]
- Goal: [what success looks like]
- Inputs: [files/paths, selection, URLs]
- Constraints: [time, style, APIs, security]
- Tools: [what you expect it to use]
- Output: [schema/format]
- Checks: [build, lint, tests]

## Final thoughts

Context engineering complements prompt engineering by turning ad‑hoc prompting into a disciplined, observable system. Invest in retrieval, memory, window management, schemas, and evals. Start small (curated README, strict outputs, targeted retrieval), measure improvements, and iterate.
