# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in the Age of AI Agents

## Overview

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) describes how software moves from an idea to retirement through a series of phases with feedback loops. Understanding SDLC helps teams plan, deliver, and operate systems predictably and safely. Today, AI agents are reshaping each phase by accelerating work, changing developer roles, and introducing new governance and security requirements.

This note summarizes core SDLC concepts, why SDLC literacy matters, how AI agents impact software development, the effects across SDLC phases, and emerging paradigms for AI-native software engineering.

## What is the Software Development Life Cycle?

While terminology varies, most SDLC models include the following phases, which can be iterative and overlapping:

- Concept and feasibility: Clarify problem, value, and constraints; run feasibility and risk/benefit analysis.
- Requirements: Elicit, analyze, and document functional and non-functional needs with acceptance criteria.
- Design: Define architecture, interfaces, data models, and detailed behavior to satisfy requirements.
- Construction (implementation): Build software and supporting assets; perform component and integration tests.
- Acceptance and verification: Validate the complete system against requirements and user expectations.
- Deployment and release: Deliver to users; manage rollout, change, and training.
- Operations and maintenance: Monitor, support, fix defects, and deliver enhancements in cycles.
- Decommission: Retire the system responsibly, including data and compliance steps.

These phases provide a shared language and checkpoints for collaboration and control. See the Systems Development Life Cycle article for background and variations (waterfall, iterative, agile, DevOps).

## Why SDLC matters in software development

SDLC literacy supports:

- Predictability and flow: Scope, schedule, and risk are managed with stage gates and feedback loops.
- Quality and safety: Requirements trace to design, code, tests, deployments, and operations.
- Governance and compliance: Evidence is produced for audit, privacy, and security controls.
- Collaboration: Roles, artifacts, and handoffs are explicit across product, engineering, security, and ops.
- Continuous improvement: Metrics (lead time, change failure rate, MTTR) drive better outcomes.

## Why SDLC matters now—AI agents are here

AI agents don’t just suggest code; they take actions: calling APIs, reading/writing data, triggering pipelines, and making decisions. That brings new responsibilities:

- Non-human identities and access: Agents need their own identities, credentials, and least-privilege access; human-in-the-loop approvals are often required for sensitive actions.
- Observability and audit: Every agent action should be logged with provenance (prompt, context, tools used, data touched) for traceability.
- Evaluation and safety: Agent outputs are non-deterministic; teams need repeatable evaluation, guardrails, and rollback strategies.
- Policy and governance: Guardrails for data use, model selection, and tool access must be encoded and enforced.
- Skill shift: Developers become orchestrators—designing tasks, constraints, and review loops for agentic systems.

## Impact of AI agents in software development

Opportunities:

- Higher velocity: Code generation, refactoring, test creation, and documentation drafts reduce cycle time.
- Better DevEx: Agents automate repetitive tasks, surface context, and propose fixes across the toolchain.
- Expanded participation: Low-code/no-code plus natural language interfaces enable more contributors.
- Continuous assurance: Agents watch dependencies, security, performance, and costs, raising issues proactively.

Challenges:

- Unpredictability and explainability: Outputs vary; reasoning is opaque; evaluation requires new methods.
- Security and privacy: Expanded attack surface (prompts, tools, data), need for fine-grained authorization and data minimization.
- Quality risks: Hallucinations, insecure patterns, and automation blindness require strong review and tests.
- New supply chain: Models, prompts, datasets, tools, and agent frameworks add provenance, licensing, and drift concerns.

## Impact of AI agents on SDLC phases

- Concept and feasibility
  - Use agents to analyze markets, stakeholders, and feasibility; simulate ROI and risk scenarios.
  - Risks: Over-trust in generated assumptions; validate with human research.

- Requirements
  - Agents draft and reconcile user stories, NFRs, and acceptance criteria from interviews and telemetry.
  - Add traceability from requirements to tests and policies; keep humans as final arbiters.

- Design
  - Agents propose architectures, interface specs, sequence diagrams, and data models; compare design options.
  - Enforce design guardrails (privacy by design, threat models) with checklists and automated verification.

- Construction
  - Coding agents generate code, tests, and migrations; perform refactors; suggest fixes.
  - Require secure defaults, linters, SAST/DAST gates, and reviewer-of-record policies.

- Acceptance and verification
  - Agents generate test suites, fuzz inputs, synthesize test data, and triage failures.
  - Maintain evaluation harnesses for agentic features (task success, safety, latency, cost).

- Deployment and release
  - Agents manage canaries, rollbacks, feature flags, and release notes.
  - Use human-in-the-loop approvals for high-risk changes or data access.

- Operations and maintenance
  - Agents monitor SLIs/SLOs, recommend remediations, file issues/PRs, and auto-patch low-risk items.
  - Track model drift, prompt changes, and cost; rotate credentials and update policies regularly.

- Decommission
  - Agents assist with data migration and retention policies, revoke identities, and update inventories.

New and updated KPIs in the agentic era:

- Time-to-value from idea to deploy (with agent assistance)
- Software supply chain efficiency across planning→security
- User experience impact and incident reduction
- Review coverage of agent-generated changes and escape rate

## New software development paradigms with AI agents

- Agentic SDLC loops: Plan→Act→Observe→Learn loops encoded in pipelines, with evaluation and guardrails at each step.
- Multi-agent systems: Specialized agents (planning, coding, testing, security, docs) collaborate with defined roles and protocols.
- Developer-as-orchestrator: Engineers design tasks, constraints, and reviews; agents do the heavy lifting; humans own outcomes.
- Identity-aware automation: Every agent has scoped identity, fine-grained authorization, continuous audit, and approval workflows.
- AI supply chain security: SBOMs for models, prompts, and datasets; policy on sources and licenses; provenance and attestation.
- Safety-by-default: Policy checks for PII exposure, secrets, and data residency; sandboxed tool use; rate and budget controls.
- Low-code democratization: Product and ops roles build safe agents with templates; platform teams provide guardrails.

## Final thoughts

SDLC remains the shared map for building reliable software. AI agents change how we travel the map—faster, with new copilots and new risks. Teams that pair SDLC discipline with agentic capabilities—identity-first access, strong evaluation, human-in-the-loop controls, and clear ownership—will ship better software faster and more safely.
