# Vibe Coding

## What is vibe coding

Vibe coding is an AI-first style of software creation where a developer describes goals, constraints, or examples in natural language and lets a large language model (LLM) generate and evolve the code. The human guides with prompts, runs and inspects the result, and iterates through conversation rather than hand-writing most of the implementation. The term was popularized in 2025 (notably by Andrej Karpathy) to capture this “guide the model, don’t micromanage the code” workflow. In common use, vibe coding often implies accepting AI-written code without fully understanding every line, which increases the need for testing and guardrails.

## How it is different from traditional coding

- Input and control: natural-language specifications and examples vs. line-by-line implementation.
- Granularity: outcome- and behavior-focused prompts vs. algorithm/data-structure design and explicit control flow.
- Review depth: quick functional checks and iterative prompting vs. deep code comprehension and design reviews.
- Tooling loop: chat-and-run, regenerate, and refactor with the model vs. edit-compile-test and manual refactoring.
- Skills emphasis: product thinking, prompt craft, testing, and orchestration vs. language/framework fluency and low-level debugging.
- Risks and trade-offs: faster prototyping and accessibility for non-experts vs. higher risk of subtle bugs, security issues, and maintainability challenges if code is not audited.

## Popular vibe coding tools

- GitHub Copilot (Agent mode): Repository-aware agents that can plan changes, create/edit files, write tests, and open PRs with conversational guidance. Strong fit for iterative refactors and task automation inside existing projects.
- Cursor: An AI-powered IDE with a project “composer” and multi-file edits. Optimized for prompt-to-project flows, repo-wide context, and quick regeneration/refactoring cycles.
- Claude (Anthropic): High-reasoning model useful for multi-file planning, code generation, and design discussions. Often paired with “Claude Code” style workflows in editors/terminals to propose structured diffs and explanations.

Other adjacent tools include Replit Agent, GitHub Copilot Chat, OpenAI o-models for code reasoning, and various IDE integrations that enable chat-to-code loops.

## Conclusion

Vibe coding accelerates exploration and makes software creation more accessible by shifting effort from manual implementation to goal-setting, testing, and feedback. It is powerful for prototypes, internal tools, and learning unfamiliar stacks. For production systems, combine vibe coding with disciplined reviews, security checks, and tests to ensure correctness, maintainability, and accountability.
