# GitHub: An Introduction

## Overview

GitHub is a cloud platform for software collaboration built on Git. It hosts repositories, powers code review with pull requests, enables project planning with Issues and Projects, automates CI/CD with Actions, secures code with built‑in security features, and supports admins with robust governance. GitHub scales from open source to enterprise.

## Git basic

Git is a distributed version control system. Key concepts:

- Repository: a project’s history tracked in the hidden `.git` directory
- Commit: a snapshot of changes with message and author metadata
- Branch: an independent line of development (for example, `main`, `feature/x`)
- Merge/Rebase: combine branch histories; keep a clean mainline
- Remote: a hosted copy (for example, `origin` on GitHub)
- Clone/Pull/Push: copy a repo, fetch changes, publish changes
- Status/Log/Diff: inspect working tree, history, and changes
- .gitignore: ignore generated files and secrets

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is where developers store and review code, plan work, run automation, and ship software. Beyond Git hosting, it offers pull requests, Issues, Projects (tables, boards, and roadmaps), Actions for CI/CD, Packages, Codespaces cloud dev environments, advanced code search, Discussions, Wikis, and security tools like code scanning and Dependabot.

## Key Features

- Collaborative coding: pull requests, code review, draft PRs, protected branches, CODEOWNERS
- Project management: Issues, Projects (custom fields, insights, templates, automation)
- Automation and CI/CD: GitHub Actions, workflow templates, Marketplace, hosted/self‑hosted runners, visualization
- Cloud dev: Codespaces with dev containers and editor integration
- Application security: code scanning (CodeQL), secret scanning, Dependabot alerts and updates, dependency graph, security advisories
- Client apps: Desktop, CLI, Mobile
- Search and navigation: code search and code view
- Governance: organizations, teams, roles, audit logs, repository rules
- AI assistance: GitHub Copilot (Chat, code completion, code review, PR summaries, Desktop commit messages, agent and edits modes)

## Benefits of Using GitHub

- Centralized collaboration with traceability from issue to commit to deploy
- Faster reviews and higher quality via PR workflows and status checks
- Automation across build, test, release, and triage
- Built‑in security to prevent, find, and fix vulnerabilities
- Flexible planning tools that live next to your code
- Scales from solo projects to enterprises with strong governance

## Source code management

- Branching strategies: trunk‑based, feature branches, release branches
- Code review: required reviewers, suggestions, and conversations
- Branch protection: enforce status checks, reviews, and linear history
- CODEOWNERS: auto‑request reviewers by path or pattern
- Repository rules and insights: enforce standards and observe activity

## Collaboration

- Issues for tasks, bugs, ideas; templates and forms for consistent intake
- Discussions for Q&A and open‑ended conversations
- Wikis for project documentation
- Mentions, reactions, attachments, and Markdown everywhere
- Work anywhere with Desktop, CLI, and Mobile

## Pull requests

Pull requests (PRs) propose changes and enable review before merging. Typical flow:

1) Create a branch or fork; commit changes
2) Open a PR; link related issues; add reviewers
3) Discuss and iterate with comments and suggestions; run required checks
4) Merge with merge, squash, or rebase per repo policy; use draft PRs for early feedback

Use protected branches and required checks to keep `main` healthy.

## Issues management

- Structure: titles, descriptions, checklists, assignees, labels, milestones
- Templates and forms for faster, higher‑quality reports
- Link PRs to issues; close with keywords on merge
- Custom fields (priority, iteration, dates, story points) and insights
- Sub‑issues to break down complex work; progress shows in one view
- Automation: triage, set fields, archive with project workflows

## GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop is a GUI app for Windows and macOS that streamlines Git workflows—clone, branch, commit, resolve conflicts, and push—without the command line. It integrates with pull requests and Issues, and supports Copilot‑generated commit messages in Desktop.

## Project management with GitHub using Kanban/Agile style

Use Projects to plan and track work alongside code:

- Views: boards (Kanban), tables, and roadmaps; save sprints, backlogs, teams, or releases
- Custom fields: iterations, priority, story points, dates, and single‑selects
- Insights: burn‑up charts and dashboards to see flow and bottlenecks
- Automation: rules and workflows to triage, set fields, and archive
- Keyboard‑first: filter, group, sort, and assign without leaving the keyboard

Pair Projects with Issues and PRs for end‑to‑end visibility from idea to deploy.

## Conclusion

GitHub brings code, collaboration, automation, planning, and security into one platform. Start with Issues and pull requests, add Projects for planning, automate with Actions, and use Copilot to accelerate everyday tasks—then scale with governance and security as your team grows.
