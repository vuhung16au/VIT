### Implementation Goals
Your Docker Compose configuration should:
- Define all services with proper networking
- Establish service dependencies and startup order
- Configure persistent data storage
- Enable horizontal scaling capabilities


## Phase 2: Docker Compose Implementation

### Task: Create the docker-compose.yml Configuration
Your primary deliverable is a comprehensive `docker-compose.yml` file that orchestrates all application services. This file will define service configurations, networking, volumes, and dependencies to create a cohesive application environment.

**Key Requirements:**
- All services must be properly isolated yet able to communicate
- Implement Docker's default networking for inter-service communication
- Configure persistent storage for critical data
- Establish proper service startup dependencies

### Sample Implementation Structure
Here's a reference implementation to guide your development:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  frontend:
    image: react-app:latest
    build:
      context: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    depends_on:
      - backend
    networks:
      - app-network

  backend:
    image: node-api:latest
    build:
      context: ./backend
    environment:
      - MONGODB_HOST=db
      - MONGODB_USER=root
      - MONGODB_PASSWORD=secret
      - REDIS_HOST=redis
      - RABBITMQ_HOST=rabbitmq
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis
      - rabbitmq
    networks:
      - app-network

  db:
    image: mongo:4.4
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: root
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret
      MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE: ecommerce
    volumes:
      - db_data:/data/db
    networks:
      - app-network

  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
    networks:
      - app-network

  rabbitmq:
    image: rabbitmq:management
    networks:
      - app-network

  monitoring:
    image: prom/prometheus
    container_name: prometheus
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    networks:
      - app-network

networks:
  app-network:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  db_data:
```

## Phase 3: Service Configuration Analysis

### Frontend Service Configuration
**Implementation Details:**
- Hosts a React.js application with Nginx as the web server
- Establishes dependency on the backend service for proper startup sequence
- Exposes port 80 for external access to the user interface
