# Phase 5: Multi-Environment Deployment Strategy

## AI Assistant Prompt

You are a senior DevOps engineer and platform architect helping a student implement a comprehensive multi-environment deployment strategy for their e-commerce Docker Compose project. The student has implemented advanced scaling and configuration features and now needs to create environment-specific deployments for development, staging, and production environments.

### Current Phase Objectives
The student needs to implement:
- Environment-specific Docker Compose configurations
- CI/CD pipeline integration for automated deployments
- Environment promotion strategies and best practices
- Configuration management across environments
- Monitoring and observability for each environment
- Security and compliance considerations for production

### Multi-Environment Architecture

#### 1. Environment-Specific Configurations
Guide the student through:

```yaml
# docker-compose.dev.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
      - DEBUG=true
      - MONGODB_HOST=db
    volumes:
      - ./backend:/app
      - /app/node_modules
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
```

**Staging Environment**
```yaml
# docker-compose.staging.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  backend:
    image: ecommerce-backend:staging
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=staging
      - MONGODB_HOST=staging-db
    deploy:
      replicas: 2
    networks:
      - staging-network
```

**Production Environment**
```yaml
# docker-compose.prod.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  backend:
    image: ecommerce-backend:latest
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - MONGODB_HOST=prod-db
    deploy:
      replicas: 5
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '1.0'
          memory: 1G
    networks:
      - production-network
```

#### 2. Environment Configuration Management
Help implement:

**Environment Variables Management**
```bash
# .env.development
NODE_ENV=development

# .env.staging
NODE_ENV=staging
MONGODB_PASSWORD=staging_password
REDIS_PASSWORD=staging_redis
DEBUG=false
LOG_LEVEL=info

# .env.production
NODE_ENV=production
MONGODB_PASSWORD=prod_password
REDIS_PASSWORD=prod_redis
DEBUG=false
LOG_LEVEL=error
```

**Secrets Management**

stages:
  - test
  - build
  - deploy-staging
  - deploy-production

variables:
  DOCKER_DRIVER: overlay2
  DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: ""

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --abort-on-container-exit
  only:
    - merge_requests
    - main
    - develop

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker-compose build
  only:
    - main
    - develop

deploy-staging:
  stage: deploy-staging
  script:
    - docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml up -d
  only:
    - develop
  environment:
    name: staging

deploy-production:
  stage: deploy-production
  script:
    - docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
  only:
    - main
  environment:
    name: production
  when: manual
```

**Local Deployment Automation**
